This Wharton course provided an introduction to the wide range of techniques available for statistical modelling and forecasting of time series. Regression methods for decomposition models, trends and seasonality, spectral analysis, distributed lag models, autoregressive-moving average modeling, forecasting, exponential smoothing, and ARCH and GARCH models was surveyed. The emphasis was on applications, rather than technical foundations and derivations. The techniques were studied critically, with an examination of their usefulness and limitations.
